Description: Use $USER instead of $LOGNAME in the default friendly_name
 Using $USER in the friendly name will display which user minidlna is
 running as on the clients, which can be helpful for detecting problems.
 Using $LOGNAME on the other hand will display "root" as the username if
 minidlna was started using the init script, regardless of which user
 minidlna is currently running as.
