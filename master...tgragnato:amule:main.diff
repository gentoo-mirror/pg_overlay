-To build on MacOSX, there are some experimental scripts located in src/utils/scripts/MacOSX
-
-An example basic flow to create an SVN build is to do the following from the root folder where this file is located:
-
-
-mkdir Build
-cd Build/
-WXVERSION=svn WXPORT=cocoa MULECLEAN=YES ../src/utils/scripts/MacOSX/full_build.sh
-
-
-Those commands would build a MacOSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) compatible application bundle for aMule and aMuleGUI
-using the architecture of the build system ( i386 or x86_64 ), with the latest SVN version of wxWidgets.
-
-Other parameters are explained upon execution of the script.
-
-The above command was tested on MacOSX 10.7.1 Lion on a x86_64 architecture and provided valid binaries.
-Unfortunately, other systems may fail silently, or loudly, and there is not much error reporting support.

-Good luck!

 Overview
 --------
 
@@ -48,57 +38,4 @@ Features
 Compiling
 ---------
 
-In general, compiling aMule should be as easy as running `configure` and `make`.
-There are [detailed instructions][1] on the wiki for compiling on a number of
-different platforms, though they may be outdated a bit... (updates are welcome).
-
-[1]: http://wiki.amule.org/wiki/Compile		"How to compile and install aMule"
-
-
-Setting Up
-----------
-
-aMule comes with reasonable default settings and should be usable as-is.
-However, to receive a [HighID] you need to open aMule's ports on your
-firewall and/or forward them on your router. Again, you'll find detailed
-articles on the wiki helping you [get HighID][2] and [setting up firewall
-rules][3] for aMule.
-
-[HighID]: http://wiki.amule.org/wiki/FAQ_eD2k-Kademlia#What_is_LowID_and_HighID.3F

-Reporting Bugs
---------------
-
-We aren't perfect and so aMule isn't perfect, too. We know that. If you find a
-bug or miss a feature you can report/request it either on the [forum], the
-[bug tracker][4] or on [GitHub][5].

-Contributing
-------------
-
-*Contributions are always welcome!*
-
-You can contribute to aMule several ways:
-
-* Contributing code. You can fix some bugs, implement new features, or
-  whatever you want. The preferred way is opening a [pull request][6] on
-  GitHub, but you can also post your patch on the [forum].
-* Translating. You can [translate aMule][7], [translate the wiki][8] or
-  [translate aMule's documentation][9] to your language.

- Requirements
---------------
-
-  To compile aMule, you'll need at least the following packages:
-    * zlib >= 1.1.4       (1.2.3 is recommended)
-    * wxWidgets >= 2.8.0  (2.8.9 is recommended)
-    * Crypto++ >= 5.1     (5.5.2 is recommended)
-    * the perl File::Copy module
-
-  For aMuleWeb you'll also need:
-    * a POSIX compliant regex library (like libgnurx or libregex, for most
-      GNU systems it's part of the standard C library).
-
-  Optionally you may want to provide:
-    * libgd (or gdlib) >= 2.0.0, to let cas generate statistics images;
-    * libupnp >= 1.6.6 if you want to have UPnP support;
-    * libpng >= 1.2.0 to let aMuleWeb generate nice statistics graphs;
-    * libGeoIP >= 1.4.4 if you want colourful country flags and IP to country
-      mappings in the GUI;
-    * gettext >= 0.11.5 if you want to enable NLS (Native Language Support).
-
-  It is known to compile with GCC 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3;
-  Sun Studio 12 and MSVC. GCC 2.95 is not supported.
-
-  aMule requires a wxWidgets builds that supports unicode. Since wxWidgets
-  does not support unicode with GTK1, it is not possible to make aMule use
-  GTK1.
-
-  As Crypto++ is very sensitive to compiler defects, if you're compiling it
-  from source be sure to always test your compilation with `cryptest.exe v'.
-  (Yes, it's called cryptest.exe on all platforms.) Only when all tests
-  passed may you safely go on with compiling aMule.
-  Adding "-DCRYPTOPP_DISABLE_ASM -O1" to CXXFLAGS is known to resolve
-  these problems.
-
-
- Compiling aMule
------------------
-
-  Compiling and installing aMule is as easy as running the usual
-
-    ./configure
-    make
-    make install
-
-  commands (if you have all the above requirements fulfilled, of course).
-
-  Solutions for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and the free Express Edition
-  are included. Please see the readme file for more information.
-
-
- ADVANCED OPTIONS
-------------------
-
-  These are some of the available configure options:
-
-    --disable-debug           disable additional debugging output
-    --enable-optimize         enable code optimizing
-    --enable-amulecmd         compile aMule command line client
-    --enable-amule-gui        compile aMule remote GUI (EXPERIMENTAL)
-    --enable-amule-daemon     compile aMule daemon version
-    --enable-webserver        compile aMule WebServer
-    --enable-cas              compile C aMule Statistics
-    --enable-wxcas            compile aMule GUI Statistics
-    --disable-ed2k            don't compile aMule ed2k links handler
-    --enable-alc              compile aMuleLinkCreator GUI version
-    --enable-alcc             compile aMuleLinkCreator for console
-    --disable-monolithic      disable building of the monolithic aMule app
-
-  For a full list of available options run `./configure --help' from the
-  aMule source directory.

-                         The All-platform eD2k Client
-
-
- About
--------
-  aMule is a multi-platform ed2k client, fork of the eMule client, using the
-  wxWidgets class library. It was originally forked from the xMule project,
-  which in turn was forked from the lMule project. This in turn was the first
-  fork of eMule to run natively on GNU/Linux and other Unix-like systems.
-
-
- Installation
---------------
-  See INSTALL file
-
-
- Configuration:
-----------------
-  - Go to the "Preferences" tab
-
-  - Enter a nickname or leave as the default value.
-
-  - Enter the "Download Capacity" and "Upload Capacity" according to your
-    Internet connection. All values in aMule are kiloBytes (kB), but your
-    Internet Service Provider's numbers are most likely kiloBits (kb).
-
-    8 kiloBits make up 1 kiloByte, so if your Internet Connection is 768kb
-    Downstream and 128kb Upstream (i.e. German Telekom DSL), your correct
-    values are:
-
-      Downstream: 768kb / 8 = 96kB, so you enter 96 as "Download Capacity"
-      Upstream:   128kb / 8 = 16kB, so you enter 16 as "Upload Capacity"
-
-    Anyway, these values are used to calculate the current bandwidth usage for
-    display purposes only (mainly for statistics). Nevertheless, you need to
-    know them to determine the following down/upload limits:
-
-  - Enter "Download Limit" and "Upload Limit"  (IMPORTANT!)
-
-    Download Limit:
-        Leave this at 0, which stands for "no limit". However, if aMule uses
-        too much bandwidth and causes problems with other applications using
-        your Internet connection, it would be a good idea to limit this to
-        approximately 80% of your downstream capacity.
-
-    Upload Limit:
-        It is recommended that you set this limit to around 80% of your actual
-        upstream capacity, in order to avoid degrading the performance of your
-        connection.
-
-    Setting the Upload Limit to a value less than 10 will automatically reduce
-    your Download Limit after the following schema:
-
-      Upload Limit  |  Max Download
-         >= 10      |    No limit
-          < 10      |    Upload Limit * 4
-          <  4      |    Upload Limit * 3
-
-
-    NOTE: 56k Modem users: aMule only accepts integral values for these
-          settings, you can't enter 1.6 or whatever your sweet-spot setting
-          is. Sorry.
-
-  - "Maximum Connections":
-    As a general rule, set it to 500 - 2000.
-
-  - "Maximum Sources per File":
-    This depends on how many files you tend to download at a time, if you
-    tend to download few files, high values are acceptable, otherwise go
-    for lower values so that all files will be able to get sources.
-
-  - Choose the directories you want to share with other users:
-    DO NOT SHARE YOUR COMPLETE HARDDISK!
-
-    It is suggested that you either use the "Incoming" folder or a separate
-    folder for the files you wish to share, to avoid inadvertently sharing
-    private files.
-
-    If you share more than 200 files, you should consider that some servers
-    have a hard limit due to resource constraints, which means that you may
-    be kicked from them if you share too many files or that some of your
-    files won't be populated to the network through that server. So it is not
-    always a good idea to share lots of files.
-
-  - Other:
-    The other options are pretty self-explanatory. If you don't know what it
-    does, don't touch it as a general rule. More information on getting started
-    can be found in the aMule wiki:
-      http://wiki.amule.org/wiki/Getting_Started
-
-    Don't forget to connect to a server, or you probably won't download too much.
-
-
- Basic aMule Tips
-------------------
-  * NEVER run aMule as root.
-  * If you are behind a firewall or router, be sure that the ports have been
-    opened. The default ports are 4662 (TCP). 4665 (UDP) and 4672 (UDP). If
-    these are blocked, you will receive a "LowID" which results in fewer
-    available sources for the files you are downloading.
-  * Obtain an appropriate server.met: e.g., if you are a dial-up, using
-    a large server list is not appropriate.
-  * Set your temp and shared directories in Preferences->Directories
-    * To recursively select a certain directory, right-click over it.
-    * You should *NOT* share
-      * Your temp download directory!
-      * Your /etc directory
-      * Probably not your /var, /lib, /boot, or /usr directory
-      * Certainly make sure that any really confidential files (password files,
-        private SSH keys, credit card numbers :) are *not* shared. So generally
-        do not share your entire home directory, although you might want to
-        share some files or directories in it.
-  * Remember that you get certain download privileges with those clients
-    (aMule, eMule, etc users) to whom you upload files, in the form of reduced
-    queue waits.
-  * Please note that compilation with optimizations is supported. However, if
-    you pull a Gentoo, we will probably just tell you to recompile aMule and/or
-    your system with sane compiler-flags before we will attempt to address the
-    problem.
-
-
- Obtaining your first server list
-----------------------------------
-  Use one of the following links in the "Update server.met from URL" box in
-  the Server tab. They are apparently updated every 20 minutes.
-
-  * The current top 50 servers (these fill up fast):
-      http://ocbmaurice.dyndns.org/pl/slist.pl/server.met?download
-  * The current top 150 servers:
-      http://ocbmaurice.dyndns.org/pl/slist.pl/server.met?download/server-good.met
-  * The biggest list (about 300 servers) maintained by the site. Only if you
-    have a very decent connection:
-      http://ocbmaurice.dyndns.org/pl/slist.pl/server.met?download/server-max.met
-  * Should maurice be down for some reasons, use this server.met instead:
-      http://www.srv1000.com/azz/server.met
-
-  If these are non-functional, simply google for 'server.met'.

- FAQ:
-------
-  -- How do I know whether my ID is high or low? --
-
-  Look at the arrows at the bottom right corner, wrapping a world icon, next to
-  the server name you are connected to. If they're green, your ID is high. If
-  they're yellow, your ID is low.
-
-
-  -- What does high and low ID mean anyway? --
-
-  When your ID is high (green arrows), everything is fine.
-  When it's low (yellow arrows), you are probably behind a firewall or a
-  router, and other clients can't connect to you directly (which is a bad
-  thing). Please read the FAQ, search our wiki or forums on how to configure
-  your firewall/router for aMule.
-
-  NOTE: you can also get a low ID when the server you connected to is too busy
-  to answer properly, or simply badly configured. When you are sure your
-  settings are OK and you SHOULD have a high ID, connect to another server.
-
-
-  -- I'd like to search for specific file types, what filter stands for which files? --
-
-  File Type Extensions found (this list is far from being complete)
-  --------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Audio         .mp3 .mp2 .mpc .wav .ogg .flac .aac .ape .au .wma
-  Video         .avi .mpg .mpeg .ram .rm .vob .divx .mov .ogv .webm .vivo
-  Program       .exe .com
-  Archive       .zip .rar .ace .tar.gz .tar.bz2 .Z .arj .cbz .cbr
-  CDImage       .bin .cue .iso .nrg .ccd .sub .img
-  Picture       .jpg .jpeg .bmp .gif .tif .png
-
-
-  -- What are all those fancy colors in the download progress bar about? --
-
-  Each download in the the transfers window has a coloured bar to show current
-  file availability and progress.
-
-  * Black shows the parts of the file you already have
-  * Red indicates a part missing in all known sources
-  * Different shades of blue represent the availability of this part in the
-    sources. The darker the blue is the higher the availability
-  * Yellow denotes a part being downloaded
-  * The green bar on top shows the total download progress of this file
-
-  If you expand the download you see its sources with the corresponding
-  bar. Here the colours have a slightly different meaning:
-
-  * Black shows parts you are still missing
-  * Silver stands for parts this source is also missing
-  * Green indicates parts you already have
-  * Yellow denotes a part being uploaded to you
-
-  Learning how the progress bar works will greatly help your understanding
-  of the eD2k network.

-  aMule is a free software project and requires the cooperation of its users
-  to improve the quality of the software. We welcome all contributions to the
-  project in the form of new features, bug fixes, feature requests, etc.
-
-  If you are not a programmer you can still contribute by providing good bug
-  reports when you come across a problem with aMule. A good bug report gives
-  the aMule Team information enough to reproduce the bug (so we can see it in
-  action) and fix it. If possible, try to isolate under which the bug occurs
-  (e.g. does it happen on some specific window, with some specific files, some
-  specific conditions etc.) and provide as much detail as you can in your
-  report.
-
-  If you are a programmer and fix a bug you observe, please send us a patch or

-aMule with Boost ASIO networking - by Stu Redman
-
-We are still having some networking problems with wxWidgets, even with 2.8.12.
-With wx 2.9 SVN networking was completely broken for some versions. So I wanted to see
-how a different networking layer behaves, and if it is even possible to integrate
-in aMule.
-I decided on Boost ASIO because of the good reputation of the Boost library.
-
-The goal is to have an aMule which can be configured to use either wx Sockets
-or ASIO sockets for all major tasks (this may exclude things like http download).
-And with ASIO sockets it should perform better at least in some aspects
-(stability, speed, CPU, memory) for this endeavour to make sense.
-
-There are no plans to "boostify" aMule. Boost is encapsulated in the implementation
-and not even included in the headers.
-
-Implementation is near complete. It's been tested in Windows and Linux.
-More testing is required.
-
-In some environments using Boost saves a lot of CPU, in others it doesn't.
-
-Not done yet:
-- better error handling/error messages
-- further abstraction (replace wx socket constants in code)
-- make use of background resolve for AsyncDNS instead of spawning a thread
-
-If you like to play with new stuff I'd like you to try it out and give me feedback.
-Especially if you are having networking problems or out of memory crashes, or if you
-are running aMule at high speeds.
-
-
-Compilation:
-
-Get current boost lib from www.boost.org . Extract it to your favorite
-place (like ~/amule/boost_1_49_0).
-Boost.Asio is header-only. It requires Boost.System for its error codes,
-but we include the single .cpp directly, so we don't need to build
-anything of boost.
-
-Configure aMule using
-  ./configure --with-boost
-or
-  ./configure --with-boost=/path/to/boost/sources
-
-Important: aMule prints "Asio thread started" in log and console on startup.
-If it doesn't you have probably configured it to use wx sockets!

-README for aMule on the Mac
-===========================
-
-Installation:
--------------
-Just drag the aMule application to a folder of your choice (e.g., /Applications). To start aMule, double-click the application icon.
-
-
-Documentation and help resources:
----------------------------------
-The heart of aMule's documentation is the aMule Wiki, which you can find at http://wiki.amule.org/index.php/Main_Page. We suggest that you start with the Getting Started Guide (http://wiki.amule.org/index.php/Getting_Started) and the aMule FAQ (http://wiki.amule.org/index.php/FAQ_aMule). These pages should give you a good idea of how to setup and use aMule.
-
-If you run into any problems you can drop by at the aMule forum (http://forum.amule.org). A lot of questions have already been answered there, so it is always a good idea to start by searching the forum for your particular problem. If you don't find an answer to your problem you can post your problem on the forum and we will do our best to help you out.
-
-The forum and particularly the Mac subsection of the forum (http://forum.amule.org/index.php?board=49.0) are also good places to look for usage tips and to learn about recent aMule developments (especially look at the sticky threads).
-
-
-Right-clicking & pop-up menus on the Mac:
------------------------------------------
-aMule contains a lot of features that are only accessible through pop-up menus, which you invoke by right-clicking a certain item. For instance, if you want to pause or cancel a download, change the upload or download priority of a file, see file details, etc. you need to do this via a right-click.
-
-If you haven't bought an additional multi-button mouse with your Mac, you only have one mouse button (the one that corresponds to a left-click or "normal" click on a multi-button mouse). Fortunately, you can emulate the second button by HOLDING DOWN THE CONTROL-KEY ON THE KEYBOARD WHILE YOU CLICK. For example, do a "control-click" now on a file that you are downloading and see how a pop-up menu shows up with further option.
-
-If you want to discover all of aMule's hidden functionalities just try to control-click everything that moves.
-This includes all the lists of files, clients & servers, all the labels on the top of these lists (e.g. "File Name"), the bar "all" at the top of the download window, ...
-
-By the way, these emulated right-clicks work system-wide. Just try control-clicking a file in the Finder, an icon in the Dock, a marked word in TextEdit or MS Word.
-
-
-Handling ed2k-Links on the Mac:
--------------------------------
-There are basically four ways to download files with aMule:
-
-(1) Search for files using aMule's search dialog and double click those search results that you want to download.
-
-(2) Copy ed2k-links from a web page into the "ED2K-Link Handler" field at the bottom of the search window of aMule and press the commit button. If the ed2k-link is longer than that text field is wide you need to make the aMule window wider until the link fits completely into the field (you can make the aMule window wider than your screen if necessary). We are working on eliminating this issue.
-
-(3) Import ed2k-links directly from your browser into aMule. See http://forum.amule.org/index.php?topic=5679.msg30209#msg30209 for more details.
-
-(4) Use a text editor (e.g. TextEdit) to paste ed2k-links into a "ED2Links" file inside "~/Library/Application Support/aMule/" and aMule will automatically import the links.
-
-
-Setting up aMule's video preview feature:
------------------------------------------
-You can use a video player like VLC or Mplayer to preview incomplete downloads of video files. To set up aMule properly for this, go to Preferences -> General. Under "Video Player", you have to enter "/usr/bin/open -a" together with the path of your video player program.
-
-For example:
-/usr/bin/open -a "/Applications/VLC.app"
-/usr/bin/open -a "/Applications/vlc-0.8.4a/VLC.app"
-/usr/bin/open -a "/Applications/MPlayer OS X 2.0b8r5/MPlayer OS X 2.app"
-
-
-Getting up-to-date snapshot builds of aMule:
---------------------------------------------
-If you are interested in running aMule versions with the latest bleeding edge features or if you want to help us test the most recent changes to the aMule code-base you download up-to-date snapshot builds of aMule. More information can be found at: http://forum.amule.org/index.php?board=49.0

-		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-		       Version 2, June 1991
-
- Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-			    Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-authors' reputations.
-
-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.
-
-		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-    parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Program.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-    customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-    received the program in object code or executable form with such
-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Program or works based on it.
-
-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-this License.
-
-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-Foundation.
-
-  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes

-			    NO WARRANTY
-
-  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS

-	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
-    (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-    GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
-when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
-be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
-  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
-Public License instead of this License.

-dnl Optimization hacks: compiling C++ is slow, especially with Boost.  What
-dnl we're trying to do here is guess the right combination of link flags
-dnl (LIBS / LDFLAGS) to use a given library.  This can take several
-dnl iterations before it succeeds and is thus *very* slow.  So what we do
-dnl instead is that we compile the code first (and thus get an object file,
-dnl typically conftest.o).  Then we try various combinations of link flags
-dnl until we succeed to link conftest.o in an executable.  The problem is
-dnl that the various TRY_LINK / COMPILE_IFELSE macros of Autoconf always
-dnl remove all the temporary files including conftest.o.  So the trick here
-dnl is to temporarily change the value of ac_objext so that conftest.o is
-dnl preserved accross tests.  This is obviously fragile and I will burn in
-dnl hell for not respecting Autoconf's documented interfaces, but in the
-dnl mean time, it optimizes the macro by a factor of 5 to 30.

-
-dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.
-
-dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
-dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
-dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
-dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
-dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
-dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
-dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
-dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
-dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
-dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
-dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
-dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
-dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
-dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
-dnl    the value `$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
-dnl
-dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
-dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
-dnl    and used.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
-dnl    Catalog format: none
-dnl    Catalog extension: none
-dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
-dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
-dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
-dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
-dnl maintainers.

-        dnl   Unlike for the UNICODE setting, you can build your program in

-        dnl      ./configure --disable-shared --with-wxshared
-        dnl
-        dnl   will build your library in static mode against the first available
-        dnl   shared build of wxWidgets.
-        dnl
-        dnl   Note that's not possible to do the viceversa:
-        dnl
-        dnl      ./configure --enable-shared --without-wxshared
-        dnl
-        dnl   Doing so you would try to build your library in shared mode against a static
-        dnl   build of wxWidgets. This is not possible (you would mix PIC and non PIC code) !
-        dnl   A check for this combination of options is in WX_DETECT_STANDARD_OPTION_VALUES
-        dnl   (where we know what 'auto' should be expanded to).
-        dnl
-        dnl   If you try to build something in ANSI mode against a UNICODE build
-        dnl   of wxWidgets or in RELEASE mode against a DEBUG build of wxWidgets,

-\f0\fs20 \cf0 This project allows for compilation of aMule in Xcode \ul without\ulnone  macports / fink. THIS IS NOT AN EASY PROCESS, so only attempt it if you're familiar with the terminal, and compiling programs there, as wxWidgets and cryptopp are still compiled via the terminal. I hope to automate this process in the future to eliminate that requirement.\
-\
-Compiling aMule on Xcode is important to automate the build of different configurations, ensure proper compatibility, and allow developers to use the Xcode interface to gdb which is tremendously useful to track and solve bugs. \
-\
-Current configuration supports i386/ppc build on SDK 10.4 (for Tiger), without country flags or UPnP, using wxWidgets 2.8.x. Other configurations will be added later.\
-\
-It's important for building that the following steps/requirements are met:\
-\
-1) This folder structure is needed for compilation:\
-  \
-  <some folder in your computer>\
-	|\
-	|-> aMule sources\
-	|\
-	|-> wxWidgets-2.8 (or wxWidgets for 2.9+)\
-	|\
-	|-> cryptopp (or cryptopp-64bits if you are using Snow Leopard and plan to use wxWidgets 2.9+ and SDK 10.6)\
-	\
-It's essential that the folders are named exactly like shown. If you want to change this, take a look at CFLAGS and link flags in the "aMule" target's properties.\
-\
-2) wxWidgets has to be compiled with universal binary support and static library. When using wxWidgets 2.8 on Snow Leopard, it's important that gcc-4.0 is used because gcc-4.2 defaults to 64bits builds, which wxWidgets 2.8.x doesn't support (see {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Development:_wxMac#Building_on_Snow_Leopard_for_Snow_Leopard"}}{\fldrslt http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Development:_wxMac#Building_on_Snow_Leopard_for_Snow_Leopard}} for more info).\

-\f0\fs20 \cf0 After that, just type "make" as usual. Do not "make install".\
-\
-3) Compiling cryptopp is complicated due to lack of proper support for building on MacOSX, especially for universal binaries. First download a cryptopp release from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.cryptopp.com/#download"}}{\fldrslt http://www.cryptopp.com/#download}} (latest are at the bottom) and uncompress it to the folder named "cryptopp" or "cryptopp-64bits" as shown in the folder structure above. If you are using wxWidgets 2.9+, then configure and compile as usual. If using wxWidgets 2.8 in Snow Leopard, edit the file named GNUmake and add the following lines at the beginning:\

-How to build aMule with Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition
-
-See also http://www.amule.org/wiki/index.php/HowTo_compile_with_Visual_Studio
-
-This solution for Microsoft's Visual Studio 2010 has been configured to be as easy as possible to set up. 
-
-However, given the size of the aMule project and the libraries it uses, along with limitations in the way Visual Studio works,
-a couple of items must be setup separately. Additionally, some source code files might need patching due to incompatibilities 
-with some generated files. 
-
-The solution expects to find the following items:
-
-* wxWidgets ( http://www.wxwidgets.org ) at a specific location: ..\..\wxWidgets\ from the solution directory.
-* crypto++ ( http://www.cryptopp.com/ ) at a specific location: ..\..\cryptopp\ from the solution directory.
-
-
-This means you must create a folder where you will compile aMule, and it must have this structure:
-
-- <Root folder> - Your main folder. You can name it whatever you want.
- | 
- | - wxWidgets ( wxWidgets sources, no intermediate subfolder )
- |
- | - wxWidgets29 ( wxWidgets 2.9 sources, only required if you want to build against unstable wx 2.9 )
- |
- | - cryptopp ( Crypto++ sources, no intermediate subfolder )
- |
- | - <amule-sources> ( aMule sources, no intermediate subfolder, can have any name )
-
-
-I hope this is simple enough to get you started. 
-
-If wxWidgets fails to compile, please read http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Microsoft_Visual_CPP_Guide
-
-There is sometimes a problem with the cryptopp project in the release and debug build, if some projects fail to link
-and give you a warning about redefined symbols, go to the properties on the cryptopp project, configuration "release" and change
-the "Configuration Properties"->"C/C++"->"Code generation"->"Runtime library" to "Multithreaded DLL (/MD)"
- in the release build or "Multithreaded Debug DLL (/MDd)" for the debug build. 
-
-There are 3 solutions:
-1) aMule-MSVC10E.sln
-   which includes aMule, aMule tools and aMule's internal libs
-2) aMule-MSVC10E-ExtLibs.sln
-   includes only wxWidgets and Crypto++ and builds a single library libext.lib from them. You must first build this solution before building aMule-MSVCE.sln
-3) aMule-MSVC10E-ExtLibs29.sln
-   same but using wxWidgets 2.9
-
-
-The Debug/Release configs build against wxWidgets 2.8 (stable), Debug29/Release29 configs build against wxWidgets 2.9 (unstable)
-
-To build aMule with GeoIP see libs\libGeoIP\readme.txt . 
-Without it you get an error building libGeoIP when you build the full solution.
-Just ignore it or unload the libGeoIP project.
-
-
-If aMule fails to compile, here are some guidelines/patches to the most common problems:
-
-[*] If Scanner.cpp fails to compile, apply this change around line 1545:
-
--        b->yy_is_interactive = file ? (isatty( fileno(file) ) > 0) : 0;
-+        b->yy_is_interactive = 0;
-
-if necessary.
-
-[*] The file muuli_wdr.cpp can also fail if it hasn't been patched for MSVC in the current code. The most common problem comes 
-from this kind of lines:
-
-        _("For a film you can say its length, its story, language ...\n"
-          "and if it's a fake, you can tell that to other users of aMule."),
-
-Notice the opening and closing parentheses are on a different line, and the quotes opened again. While this is ok for gcc, Visual
-Studio won't allow it. Change this lines to be a single-line quoted text. In the above example, the result will be:
-
-	_("For a film you can say its length, its story, language ...\nand if it's a fake, you can tell that to other users of aMule."),
-
-And that should be it. Feel free to ask in the aMule forum at forum.amule.org, "Compilation problems" section if you have further
-doubts.
-
-If you want to run aMule from inside Visual Studio, always set
-_NO_DEBUG_HEAP=1
-in Properties / Debugging / Environment!

-# This script is only useful if your source is in a SVN working copy!
-#
-# Problem: whenever you add a new wxWidgets version and convert the VC6 projects,
-# they are converted to VC8 XML .vcproj . In the process, a new project GUID is created.
-# When you then open your solution, all GUIDs are updated.
-#
-# To avoid this:
-# 1) Open and close wx.dsw with VS9 to convert to wx.sln (VS10 can't open them)
-# 2) Open and close wx.sln, creating the .vcxproj
-# 3) Run this script. It will replace the new GUIDs in the wx vcxproj by the old ones from the aMule-MSVC10E-ExtLibs.sln .
-# 4) Now load aMule-MSVCE-ExtLibs.sln. It won't be changed anymore.

-How to build aMule with GeoIP support
-
-The MaxMind GeoIP library can detect the country an IP address comes from. aMule uses this information
-to display a little country flag for each source or ed2k server.
-Since this is an external library it is disabled by default. This is how to enable it:
-
-Download the free GeoIP C library from http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/c/GeoIP-1.4.6.tar.gz
-From the folder libGeoIP take GeoIP.h and GeoIP.c and put them into "MSVC Solution\libs\libGeoIP"
-(removing the dummy files there).
-
-Rebuild aMule. That's it. :-)

-How to build aMule with Visual Studio 2013 Express Edition
-
-See also http://www.amule.org/wiki/index.php/HowTo_compile_with_Visual_Studio
-
-This solution for Microsoft's Visual Studio 2013 has been configured to be as easy as possible to set up.
-
-However, given the size of the aMule project and the libraries it uses, along with limitations in the way Visual Studio works,
-a couple of items must be setup separately. Additionally, some source code files might need patching due to incompatibilities 
-with some generated files. 
-
-The solution expects to find the following items:
-
-* wxWidgets ( http://www.wxwidgets.org ) at a specific location: ..\..\wxWidgets\ from the solution directory.
-* crypto++ ( http://www.cryptopp.com/ ) at a specific location: ..\..\cryptopp\ from the solution directory.
-
-
-This means you must create a folder where you will compile aMule, and it must have this structure:
-
-- <Root folder> - Your main folder. You can name it whatever you want.
- | 
- | - wxWidgets ( wxWidgets 2.8 sources, no intermediate subfolder ), or
- |
- | - wxWidgets30 ( wxWidgets 3.0 sources, no intermediate subfolder )
- |
- | - cryptopp ( Crypto++ sources, no intermediate subfolder )
- |
- | - <amule-sources> ( aMule sources, no intermediate subfolder, can have any name )
-
-
-I hope this is simple enough to get you started. 
-
-If wxWidgets fails to compile, please read http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Microsoft_Visual_CPP_Guide
-
-There is sometimes a problem with the cryptopp project in the release and debug build, if some projects fail to link
-and give you a warning about redefined symbols, go to the properties on the cryptopp project, configuration "Release" and change
-the "Configuration Properties"->"C/C++"->"Code generation"->"Runtime library" to "Multithreaded DLL (/MD)"
-in the release build or "Multithreaded Debug DLL (/MDd)" for the debug build.
-
-There are 3 solutions:
-1) aMule-MSVC12E.sln
-   which includes aMule, aMule tools and aMule's internal libs
-2) aMule-MSVC12E-ExtLibs.sln
-   includes only wxWidgets and Crypto++ and builds a single library libext.lib from them. You must first build this solution before building aMule-MSVCE.sln
-3) aMule-MSVC12E-ExtLibs30.sln
-   same but using wxWidgets 3.0
-
-
-The Debug/Release configs build against wxWidgets 2.8, Debug30/Release30 configs build against wxWidgets 3.0
-
-To build aMule with GeoIP see libs\libGeoIP\readme.txt . 
-Without it you get an error building libGeoIP when you build the full solution.
-Just ignore it or unload the libGeoIP project.
-
-
-If aMule fails to compile, here are some guidelines/patches to the most common problems:
-
-[*] If Scanner.cpp fails to compile, apply this change around line 1545:
-
--        b->yy_is_interactive = file ? (isatty( fileno(file) ) > 0) : 0;
-+        b->yy_is_interactive = 0;
-
-if necessary.
-
-[*] The file muuli_wdr.cpp can also fail if it hasn't been patched for MSVC in the current code. The most common problem comes 
-from this kind of lines:
-
-        _("For a film you can say its length, its story, language ...\n"
-          "and if it's a fake, you can tell that to other users of aMule."),
-
-Notice the opening and closing parentheses are on a different line, and the quotes opened again. While this is ok for gcc, Visual
-Studio won't allow it. Change this lines to be a single-line quoted text. In the above example, the result will be:
-
-	_("For a film you can say its length, its story, language ...\nand if it's a fake, you can tell that to other users of aMule."),
-
-And that should be it. Feel free to ask in the aMule forum at forum.amule.org, "Compilation problems" section if you have further
-doubts.
-
-If you want to run aMule from inside Visual Studio, always set
-_NO_DEBUG_HEAP=1
-in Properties / Debugging / Environment!

-# This script is only useful if your source is in a SVN working copy!

-# Problem: whenever you add a new wxWidgets version and convert the VC6 projects,
-# they are converted to VC8 XML .vcproj . In the process, a new project GUID is created.
-# When you then open your solution, all GUIDs are updated.
-#
-# To avoid this:
-# 1) Open and close wx.dsw with VS9 to convert to wx.sln (VS10 can't open them)
-# 2) Open and close wx.sln, creating the .vcxproj
-# 3) Run this script. It will replace the new GUIDs in the wx vcxproj by the old ones from the aMule-MSVC10E-ExtLibs.sln .
-# 4) Now load aMule-MSVCE-ExtLibs.sln. It won't be changed anymore.

-How to build aMule with GeoIP support
-
-The MaxMind GeoIP library can detect the country an IP address comes from. aMule uses this information
-to display a little country flag for each source or ed2k server.
-Since this is an external library it is disabled by default. This is how to enable it:
-
-Download the free GeoIP C library from http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/c/GeoIP-1.4.6.tar.gz
-From the folder libGeoIP take GeoIP.h and GeoIP.c and put them into "MSVC Solution\libs\libGeoIP"
-(removing the dummy files there).
-
-Rebuild aMule. That's it. :-)

-		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-		       Version 2, June 1991
-
- Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-		    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
- numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
-
-			    Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
-other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
-your libraries, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
-you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
-with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
-the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
-version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
-the original authors' reputations.
-
-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
-software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
-transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
-we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
-free use or not licensed at all.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
-GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
-license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
-designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
-one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
-the same as in the ordinary license.
-
-  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
-they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
-program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
-changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
-analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
-a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
-derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
-treats it as such.
-
-  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
-Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
-sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
-concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
-
-  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
-users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
-libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
-permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
-preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
-libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
-this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
-changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
-will lead to faster development of free libraries.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
-works together with the library.
-
-  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
-General Public License rather than by this special one.
-
-		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
-contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
-party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
-General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
-addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
-distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-			    NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Library General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the
-    Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330,
-    Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA.
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
-  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-That's all there is to it!

-AMPS - AMule PHP Statistics
-
-Copyright (c) 2004-2011 Matt Britt ( uberpenguin@hotpop.com )
-Thanks to BigBob for writing the original aStats, which inspired this script
-
-To use AMPS, just copy this entire directory somewhere under your HTTP
-server's document root. AMPS requires that your PHP binaries have been
-compiled with GD and FreeType support (configure options '--with-gd[=DIR]
---enable-gd-native-ttf'). Since AMPS has to access files outside the document
-root of your webserver (specifically the aMule signature file), the safe_mode
-option in your '/etc/php.ini' MUST be set to 'off'. If you want AMPS to display
-in a different language, append '?lang=xx' to the 'index.php' file where 'xx' is
-the two-letter country code (assuming that translation exists) such as en, de,
-fr, etc. If you input a country code the script does not recognize, it will
-simply default to en. Or you could just use the handy language selection drop-
-down list at the bottom of the page!
-
-AMPS looks for the aMule signature file (amulesig.dat) in /tmp. So make sure
-amulesig.dat is actually being written to /tmp (the default is ~/.aMule).
-
-If you would like to add a translation in your language, open the file 'en.inc'
-in the 'langs/' directory, translate all the strings, and save the translated
-file as 'xx.inc' where 'xx' is the two-leter language code (en, fr, etc). That's
-it! Also, you probably will want to add the two-letter language code to the
-array $completedlangs that is set near the top of 'index.php'. If you produce a
-translation, please be sure to send it to me for inclusion in the main
-distribution!
-
-Sometime in the near future I will complete the theme support I have stubbed
-into the script. If you have a colour scheme that you think looks good, modify
-'style.css' and be sure to send me a copy of your new style so I can include it
-in future versions!
-
-Please send any bugs, translations, or verbal abuse to <uberpenguin@hotpop.com>
-
-Questions or comments regarding translations can be directed to the respective
-translators listed in the CHANGELOG file.

-AMPS settings: documentation for the constants defined in AMPS
-
-General
--------
-
-VERSION		:	Version number of AMPS
-AMULESIGDAT	:	Path of the aMule signature file. This must correspond
-			with the path specified in the Tweaks settings tab in
-			aMule. You must be sure that the user that PHP scripts
-			run as (apache in many default installations) has
-			sufficient privileges to read this file. If the file is
-			outside the webserver's DocumentRoot, the safe_mode
-			option in your php.ini MUST be set to Off. Default is
-			/tmp/amulesig.dat
-IMAGEPATH	:	Path (absolute or relative) where all the images AMPS
-			uses are looked for. Default is ./images
-IMAGETYPE	:	Type of image to output for error images and the
-			signature image. Valid types are jpg, gif, and png. Note
-			that your installation of GD must support the image type
-			specified here. Default is png
-
-
-Icon settings
-NOTE: All icons are assumed to be PNG. This will probably not change.
--------------
-
-CLEANSIGIMG	:	Image used as the base image for the signature. Default
-			is baseimg.png
-RUNNINGIMG	:	Icon placed beside the process status information in the
-			signature. Default is running.png
-RX0TX0IMG	:	Transmission status icon used when both RX and TX
-			traffic are zero. Default is rx0tx0.png
-RX0TX1IMG	:	Transmission status icon used when RX traffic is zero
-			and TX traffic is nonzero. Default is rx0tx1.png
-RX1TX0IMG	:	Transmission status icon used when RX traffic is nonzero
-			and TX traffic is zero. Default is rx1tx0.png
-RX1TX1IMG	:	Transmission status icon used when both RX and TX
-			traffic are nonzero. Default is rx1tx1.png
-HIGHIDIMG	:	Connection status image used when user is connected with
-			high ID. Default is conn_highid.png
-LOWIDIMG	:	Connection status image used when user is connected with
-			low ID. Default is conn_lowid.png
-NOCONNIMG	:	Connection status image used when user is not connected
-			to a server. Default is noconn.png
-TIMEGENIMG	:	Icon placed next to timestamp. Default is clock.png
-SERVERIMG	:	Icon placed next to the server info. Default is
-			serverbox.png
-SHAREDFILESIMG	:	Icon placed next to the number of shared files. Default
-			is files.png
-QUEUEIMG	:	Icon placed to the queue status information.
-
-Font information:
-NOTE: AMPS uses TrueType fonts. This may be changed to support PS type 1 or
-other font types if there is sufficient demand for it.
------------------
-
-ERRFONTPADDING	:	Number of pixels to pad around the text in error message
-			images (hopefully you'll never see these images).
-			Default is 5
-FONTSIZE	:	Font size (in points) to use on the signature image. You
-			will need to adjust this if you use a font other than
-			the default one provided with AMPS. Default is 10
-FONTFILE	:	Path and filename of the font to use for the error and
-			signature image. Right now this must be a valid TrueType
-			font that can be read by the user that the PHP script is
-			run as. Make sure this is a *good* font that supports
-			most of the European special characters used in the
-			various translations. If you modify this from the
-			default, make sure to adjust FONTSIZE accordingly.
-			Default is ./LucidaSansRegular.ttf
-IMAGETEXTCOLOR	:	Hex triplet that defines what color text to use in the
-			signature image. Default is ffffff (white)

-C AMULE STATS
-
-
-
-This is a little app that i've been using because I really didn't like aStats.
-I was too slow, so i tried to do a little remake of it in c just to learn a 
-bit more of c and do a nice app too.
-
-feel free to contact me at falso@rdk.homeip.net
-
----
-Nice things to do if you have the time and want to contribute:
-
-* Put an end to lines[] madness
-* Get the mule to formally define onlinesig format and use that to access
-  the fields, not meaningless offsets (needs a patch against/rewrite of
-  amule[d].cpp:OnlineSig() at this time)
-* Clean up confusing code

-# Denoising levels:
-#
-#	0 - do nothing, handled outside the scope of this script.
-#
-#	1 - only strip Makefiles from comments and empty lines, this should
-#	theoretically speed up 'make', although not as much that you could
-#	notice it.
-#
-#	2 - leave directory change messages from make, but silence normal
-#	command printing. No echo denoising at this level.
-#
-#	3 - silence all messages from make, and partial echo denoising.
-#
-#	4 - full denoising:
-#		* silence all messages from make
-#		* full echo denoising
-#		* compiler warning suppression
-
-
-# Syntax of this file:
-#
-#	This file gets preprocessed, all comments and empty lines removed. The
-#	preprocessor understands '#if ', '#else' and '#endif' commands, as long
-#	as they start on the first character on the line. No whitespace is
-#	allowed before the commands. Note that the space character after #if is
-#	part of the command, if it is replaced by a tab then it won't make a
-#	command anymore!
-#
-# #if truth testing:
-#
-#	#if currently understands only one keyword: 'level', followed by a number
-#	- the current denoising level. There may be any arbitrary characters
-#	between the keyword and the value - i.e. 'levels 2,3' will also match
-#	when 'level 3' matches.
-#
-# #if preprocessor commands may be nested for at least 4000 levels deep :-)
-#
-# The preprocessor script can be found at the end of this file.

-.SH NAME
-xas \- X\-Chat aMule Statistics
-.SH SYNOPSIS
-.B none
-.SH DESCRIPTION
-\fBxas\fR is a plugin for xchat. For loading see your xchat documentation. After loading 
-type /xas and it will send statistics to the channel you are in. These 
-are taken from your Online Signature file.
-For this to work, you must enable the "Online Signature" option in aMule's preferences.
-
-To enable it on every startup of xchat you can just run the autostart-xas script (in /usr/bin if you installed with \-\-prefix=/usr).
-
-\fBxas\fR was originally written by niet

-Please report bugs either on our forum (\fIhttp://forum.amule.org/\fR), or in our bugtracker (\fIhttp://bugs.amule.org/\fR).

-.SH SYNTAX
-\fBKeine\fP
-.SH BESCHREIBUNG
-\fBxas\fP ist ein Plugin für xchat. Zum Laden lese deine xchat
-Dokumentation. Nach dem Laden tippe /xas und es wird Statistiken in den
-Kanal senden in dem du gerade bist. Diese werden aus deiner Online
-Signaturdatei gelesen.  Damit dies funktioniert, musst du die
-"Online\-Signatur" Option in den aMule Einstellungen aktivieren.
-
-Um es bei jedem Start von xchat zu aktivieren, kannst du das autostart\-xas
-Skript verwenden (welches unter /usr/bin liegt, wenn du mit \-\-prefix=/usr
-installiert hast).
-
-\fBxas\fP wurde ursprünglich von niet geschrieben
